      <h2 id="first">Accessibility in Word</h2>
      <p>To start checking accessibility in Word, go to File &gt; Info &gt; Check for Issues &gt; Check Accessibility. This will open the Accessibility pane, which will display all of the issues in the file. If you click on an issue to select it, it will take you to the place in the document where the issue occurs, and will display a reason and potential fix for the issue in the Accessibility pane. A list of common issues and how to fix them can be found on the <a href="issues.html">Common Issues</a> page. The issues in Word are fairly discrete and don't often affect each other, so the workflow for which issues you work on first is mostly up to you.</p>
      <p>Most issues in Word are relatively straightforward, but some elements need to be managed in more specific ways. <a href="images.html">Handling Images</a> discusses how to make images accessible; <a href="tables.html">Table Structure</a> explains how tables should be created, and how to fix irregular tables; and <a href="styles.html">Styles and Headings</a> details how to structure a document with headings and how to modify their visual style.</p>
      <p>The <a href="formatting.html">Formatting tools</a> page shows how to use a variety of options in Word to remedy issues caused by poor formatting.</p>
      <h2>Tips for working in Word</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Unless you're judging visual content like spacing, I suggest that you show formatting marks by pressing the paragraph icon in the paragraph section of the Home tab or using the shortcut Control + Shift + 8.</li>
        <li>Always have the rulers open; they're central to basic formatting and help to show the structure of elements like columns and tables.</li>
        <li>Work on like issues together, and make sure you know how to open the appropriate panes for those issues. (e.g. when working on headings, open the Navigation Pane to see the document structure, and the Styles Pane to modify and apply heading styles)</li>
