## How to view the site locally
### Downloading a .zip file
The most basic way to view the site locally is to download the repository as a .zip file from the Code download dropdown. Unzip the folder, and open index.html in your browser. From there you can navigate like a regular website.  
**NOTE:** This project will get updated frequently, so if you download this way, you will need to redownload whenever you would like to have the latest version. You can keep your copy up to date by cloning it with git.
### Cloning with git
This is optional, but is encouraged if you would like to stay up-to-date with the repository.
1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Open the git command line and navigate to the directory you would like to download to with `cd your/directory/here`
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/PrimsAlg/a11y-ref.git`
4. When you want to update your local copy to the latest release on github, run `git pull` from inside the a11y-ref folder
