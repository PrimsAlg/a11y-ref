      <p>Hyperlinks should almost never be just a raw URL. They should always be given a title that describes the content you're linking to. So if you were to link to a YouTube video, for example, you might title the link the title of the video, rather than having the raw link. The reason for this is not only that it looks significantly better, but also that it succinctly explains to the reader where the link leads in a way a URL may not. For people who use a screen reader, titled hyperlinks serve an additional purpose. A screen reader can list off all of the links on a page, so that the user can easily locate the links they are looking for. Properly naming your links allows them to be distinct and descriptive when read in this manner.</p>
      <p>The above guidelines apply primarily to a digital document. If the document will be printed, the raw links are needed so that the reader can type them into their browser. However, you should still name them something descriptive, but you should add a footnote that contains the full URL.</p>
